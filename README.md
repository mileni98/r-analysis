# Analysis and Visualization of Data using R

This project utilizes the R programming language to conduct in-depth data analysis and visualization on the impact of psychosocial factors on risky driving. The primary goal is to expand on an existing scientific paper and provide further understanding of the topic.

To extract valuable insights from the data, various statistical analysis techniques such as analysis of variance, correlation, and regression analyses were used. The most significant findings from the analysis.R script are presented in the report markdown file.
